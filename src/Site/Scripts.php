 * The server scripts the add-on publishes into a site. The package holds the one canonical copy and never edits it in
 * place; a site gets its own at scripts/<name> and owns it from then on, because how a server commits a site's content
 * is the site's business rather than the package's. The site's copy is never read back: the package's file is always
 * the source. What was published, and a checksum of it, goes in resources/site/installed.yaml beside the library items,
 * so a later release can tell a copy the site has changed from one that has simply not caught up.
